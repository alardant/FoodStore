# FoodStore

A simple Food Store built in Angular and Typescript

To deploy the app locally, follow this steps :

clone the Github Repository
install the npm dependencies
run the app

Enjoy !

Disclaimer: this app has been built only with a front-side objective. 
The app is not connected to an API and the data displayed are written in a mock file. To go further, you can create an API for the food and develop a CRUD to add/delete/update the food.
